## NETWORK TOPOLOGY

Most of the devices are street lights. There are GPS coordinates for the basestations (all 6 of them) in the dataset.

By scattering received packets in a RSSI vs. Interference + Noise + Path Loss plot, clusters of devices are visible.

Those clusters seem to correspond to nearby cities, where the street lights should be located.


## BASIC INFO

- Timestamp, device id, payload, RSSI, SNR, SF, CR, Mtype data collected using couple thousands of end devices

- Mentioned end devices were communicating to 6 gateways, data is, however, all in one place and there is no mention of base station's ID

- Data was collected through 1 week period during the August of 2018 (from 25-08 to 31-08)
