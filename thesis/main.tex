%%%%% ACKNOWLEDGEMENETS %%%%%
\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
Firstly, I would like to start by saying big thank you to my traineeship mentors \textbf{Petar Popovski} and 
\textbf{Jimmy Jessen Nielsen}. Their office doors were always open for my research questions. Also, to all my 
colleagues from the Connectivity group of the Electrical Systems department at Aalborg University, thank you for
all enjoyable moments and help.\\

To my mentor \textbf{Petar Šolić}, who provided me with a great opportunity to connect with one of the best teams in the 
field and for giving me the freedom to shape my project the way I wanted to and for all the help during and after the research, thank you!\\

Finally, I must express my profound gratitude to my dearest family - to my mom \textbf{Divna}, my grandma \textbf{Milica}, my late uncle \textbf{Ante} and late grandpa \textbf{Josip}, and to my girl \textbf{Anja}
for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout my years of study and through the 
process of researching and writing  this thesis. None of this would be possible without them. Thank you.
