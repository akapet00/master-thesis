## Master Thesis clearer scope

Using Logistic Regression, predict possibility of sucessfully transmitted LoRaWAN message.

Prediction are to be made for given time period: wider the time period, larger the chance of successful transimission of message.

## Next steps

To understand LoRaWAN transmission mechanism:
* reread parts of Long Range and Low Power Networks for the IoT paper
* read the Analysis of the Capacity and Scalability of the LoRa WAN Technology
* read the Analysis of Latency and MAC Performance for Class A LoRaWAN

To apply EDA in Lolland dataset for start.

To gain understanding of basic concepts of Logistic Regression as well as Classification in ML.
