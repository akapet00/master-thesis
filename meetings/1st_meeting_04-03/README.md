### Master Thesis

* Project work (main body, learning, project/problem solving) @ CNT for 3½ months
* Writing @ fesb Jun-Sept

### Possible problems
* Link classification
* Traffic estimation
* Interference prediction
* Throughput prediction

### Available data
* SEAS (Lolland): Timestamp, devid, payload, RSSI, SNR, (SF, CR, Mtype, etc)

    6 APs/GWs, 1000's of devices, 1 week of data. Devices/use-case is street-lighting. We can very likely get more data from tehse guys.

* SEAS (Svebølle): Same params
 
    1 AP/GW in Svebølle

* Kamstrup
        
* TheThingsNetwork: Do they publish data?

### Next steps

Familiarizing with data sets, LoRaWAN and ML concepts & Choosing a problem / project path.

The SEAS data can be accessed at:
